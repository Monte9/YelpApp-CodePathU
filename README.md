# Project 3 - *YelpM*

**YelpM** is a Yelp search app using the [Yelp API](http://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v2/search_api).

Time spent: **5** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] Table rows for search results should be dynamic height according to the content height.
- [x] Custom cells should have the proper Auto Layout constraints.
- [x] Search bar should be in the navigation bar (doesn't have to expand to show location like the real Yelp app does).

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [x] Search results page
- [x] Infinite scroll for restaurant results.
- [x] Implement map view of restaurant results.
- [x] Implement the restaurant detail page.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [x] Added two tab bars; Search and Nearby
- [x] Added a search view (landing view) that displays 4 categories eg Bars, Restaurants etc
- [x] Nearby view added - shows restaurants based on user's location
- [x] Custom UI (dim red + white theme)
- [x] Added new map feature; drop pin to see restaurants nearby


Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. How to do an OAuth to connect with the Yelp API from scratch
2. Implementing location data (map view) in the app
3. How to write completion blocks in swift
